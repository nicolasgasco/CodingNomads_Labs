Write a function named avoids that takes a word and a string of forbidden letters, and that returns True
if the word doesn’t use any of the forbidden letters.

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a string of forbidden letters and then prints the number of words
that don’t contain any of them. Can you find a combination of 5 forbidden letters that excludes the smallest number of words?
